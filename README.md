# Machine Learning â€” Model Comparisons #

This project analyzes accuracy differences between four provided classification models given in the ```scitkit-learn``` library; we examine an SVM with the default radial basis kernel function, the multivariate Bernoulli model, the passive-aggressive model, and the multilayered perceptron neural network model.

## Data ##

Two datasets were used in 10-fold cross-validation analysis, with permission of UCI's ML Repository. The first involved congressional voting records from 1984, in which samples (people) were classified as either Democrats or Republicans. The second involved choosing mathematics heuristics to quickly prove a theorem, with this second dataset being much more complex and large in size relative to the first.

Datasets can be found below.

## Results ##

The multilayered perceptron was consistently the most accurate of the four models used in analyzing both these datasets. 

As no further testing data was given, nothing can be said about how well the MLP generalizes to further voting records.

Only 53% accuracy was attained when predicting new test values for the mathematics dataset, given its size and complexity. Despite performing the highest during cross-validation, MLP performed unpleasingly in generalization, though still quite high above the other models.

Modification of default parameters left untouched may yield more accurate results. For a visual of the cross-validation process for the mathematics dataset, please refer to ```model_comparison.png```.
